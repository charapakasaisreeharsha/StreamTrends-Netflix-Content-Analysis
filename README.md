3. Which countries produce the most content available on Netflix?
4. What is the average duration of movies and TV shows (number of seasons)?
5. What is the distribution of age ratings (e.g., TV-MA, PG-13) across content?
6. How does the release year of content relate to age ratings (e.g., are newer releases more family-friendly or adult-oriented)?
7. What is the distribution of First Category content?
8. What is distribution of Rating with First Category?
